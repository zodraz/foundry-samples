# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to use the TextSearchProvider to add retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities to a
[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview#ai-agents) AI agent and
host it using [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme) and
deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.

## How It Works

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with `TextSearchContextProvider`

This sample uses a `TextSearchContextProvider` to demonstrate the RAG pattern. The RAG workflow operates as follows:

1. When the user asks a question, the `TextSearchContextProvider` intercepts it
2. The search function looks for relevant documents based on the query
3. Retrieved documents are injected into the model's context
4. The AI responds using both its training and the provided context
5. The agent can cite specific source documents in its answers

**Note**: The `TextSearchContextProvider` returns pre-defined snippets for demonstration purposes. In a production scenario, replace this with actual searches against your knowledge base (e.g., Azure AI Search, vector database, or other data sources).

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.
The extension builds a container image for the agent, deploys it to Azure Container Instances (ACI), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Foundry Agent Service.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. An Azure OpenAI endpoint configured
2. A deployment of a chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
3. Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
4. Python 3.10+ installed

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (required)

```powershell
# Replace with your Azure OpenAI endpoint
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"

# Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will start the hosted agent locally on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent using:

```powershell
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses -d '{"input": "What is the return policy?","stream":false}'
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Use this command to build the image locally:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
