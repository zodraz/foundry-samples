# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to use AI agents as executors within a workflow, hosted using 
[Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme) and
deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.

## How It Works

### Agents in Workflows

This sample demonstrates the integration of AI agents within a workflow pipeline. The workflow operates as follows:

1. **Research Agent** - Research market and product
2. **Market Agent** - Create market strategy
3. **Legal Agent** - Review legal considerations for the market strategy

The agents will work concurrently in a workflow, creating a comprehensive report that demonstrates:

- How AI-powered agents can be seamlessly integrated into workflow pipelines
- concurrent execution of multiple agents within a workflow

### Agent Hosting

The agent workflow is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent workflow using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent workflow can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.
The extension builds a container image for the agent, deploys it to Azure Container Instances (ACI), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Foundry Agent Service.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. An Azure OpenAI endpoint configured
2. A deployment of a chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
3. Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
4. Python 3.10+ installed

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (required)

```powershell
# Replace with your Azure OpenAI endpoint
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"

# Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will start the hosted agent workflow locally on `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Interacting with the Agent

```powershell
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses -d '{"input": "We are launching a new budget-friendly electric bike for urban commuters.","stream":false}'
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry
