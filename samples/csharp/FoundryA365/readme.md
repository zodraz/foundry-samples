# 🤖 Foundry A365 Agent Example

> A minimal example of deploying a Foundry A365 agent with Azure Developer CLI

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

**Note:** You must be enrolled in the [Frontier preview program](https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/frontier-program/) to publish a Foundry agent to Microsoft Agent 365.

Ensure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) | Infrastructure deployment tool |
| [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) | Development framework |


### 🔐 Required Permissions

- **Owner** role on the Azure subscription
- **Azure AI User** or **Cognitive Services User** role at subscription or resource group level
- **Tenant Admin** role for organization-wide configuration

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Authenticate

Login to your Azure tenant and authenticate with Azure Developer CLI:

Based on tenant security settings, sometimes just az login might be sufficient, sometimes one will need to login to each scope that is used in these scripts.

```powershell
# Login to Azure CLI
az login

az login --scope https://ai.azure.com/.default

az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default

az login --scope https://management.azure.com/.default
# Login to Azure Developer CLI
azd auth login
```

### Step 2: Deploy Everything

**Note:** Hosted agents are only available in the **North Central US** region. All resources must be created in this region.

#### Optional: Customize Your Agent

Before deploying, you can customize:
- **Agent instructions:** [AgentInstructions.cs](./src/hello_world_a365_agent/AgentLogic/AgentInstructions.cs)
- **MCP tools:** [ToolManifest.json](./src/hello_world_a365_agent/ToolingManifest.json) - [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365/tooling-servers-overview)

#### Deploy

Ensure Docker is running, then execute:

```powershell
azd provision
```

After deployment completes, retrieve your resource values:

```powershell
azd env get-values
```

> **📌 What to expect after deployment:**  
> After `azd provision` completes successfully, you will see the **AgentIdentityBlueprint** in the Agents registry. You will **not** see any agents in the requests tab yet. This is expected behavior - you must first approve the agent blueprint, configure it in Teams Developer Portal, and then create agent instances based on that blueprint.

### Step 3: Approve the Agent Blueprint

**Important:** The first step is to approve the **agent blueprint** itself. Agent instances will be created later in Step 5.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?#/agents/all/requested)
2. Under **Requests**, locate your **agent blueprint**:

3. Click the **Approve request and activate** button to approve the blueprint:

### Step 4: Configure Teams Integration

After approving the agent blueprint, configure it in the Teams Developer Portal:

1. Open the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/tools/agent-blueprint) and locate your approved agent blueprint
    
   **Note:** Only 100 Agent Blueprints are displayed. If yours isn't visible, click any blueprint to open its details page, then in the browser's address bar replace the blueprint ID portion of the URL with your own Blueprint ID from the previous step (for example: `https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/tools/agent-blueprint/<your-blueprint-id>`).

2. Get your Blueprint ID:
   ```powershell
   azd env get-values
   ```

3. Navigate to **Configuration** and add your **Bot ID** (same as Blueprint ID):
   ![Screenshot showing the Bot ID configuration field in the Teams Developer Portal](image-3.png)

### Step 5: Create Agent Instances

After configuring the agent blueprint in Teams Developer Portal, you can now create agent instances based on your blueprint:

1. In Microsoft Teams, navigate to **Apps** → **Agents for your team**
2. Find your agent blueprint and create an instance:

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This deployment orchestrates six key components to create a fully functional A365 agent:

### 1️⃣ Creating a Foundry Project

Creates a Foundry project configured to support hosted agents with appropriate permissions on an Azure Container Registry for building and storing Docker images.

📚 [Learn more about prerequisites](https://github.com/microsoft/container_agents_docs?tab=readme-ov-file#11---prerequisites)

### 2️⃣ Creating an Application

Applications provide stable endpoints and identity for exposing your agent to users while maintaining development flexibility within Foundry. The application is configured to accept requests from Azure Bot Service.

### 3️⃣ Setting up Azure Bot Service

Azure Bot Service acts as a relay between M365 ecosystem interactions and the Foundry application. The bot is configured with:

- Application endpoint
- Application's agent blueprint identity as the appId

### 4️⃣ Building a Hosted Agent

Compiles the sample code into a Docker container and registers it as a hosted agent with the Foundry project.

📚 [Learn more about building agents](https://github.com/microsoft/container_agents_docs?tab=readme-ov-file#14---build-agent-image)

### 5️⃣ Deploying the Agent

Deploys the hosted agent to the application, granting it:

- Access to the application's identity
- Configuration to serve application requests

📚 [Learn more about agent deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/container_agents_docs?tab=readme-ov-file#step-2-deploy-agent)

### 6️⃣ Publishing to Your Organization

Publishes the application to Microsoft 365 via Foundry API, creating a hireable digital worker with:

- Digital worker metadata
- Agent blueprint ID
- Digital worker designation

> **⚠️ Important**: The agent requires [admin approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/review-admin-consent-requests#review-and-take-action-on-admin-consent-requests-1) before becoming available for hiring.
