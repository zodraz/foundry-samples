# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to build a LangGraph agent with **human-in-the-loop capabilities** that can interrupt execution to ask for human input when needed, host it using the
[Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-langgraph/),
and deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli#create-a-hosted-agent) extension.

## How It Works

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration

In [main.py](main.py), the agent is created using LangGraph's `StateGraph` and includes a custom `AskHuman` tool that uses the `interrupt()` function to pause execution and wait for human feedback. The key components are:

- **LangGraph Agent**: An AI agent that can intelligently decide when to ask humans for input during task execution
- **Human Interrupt Mechanism**: Uses LangGraph's `interrupt()` function to pause execution and wait for human feedback
- **Conditional Routing**: The agent determines whether to execute tools, ask for human input, or complete the task

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-langgraph/),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli#create-a-hosted-agent) extension.
The extension builds a container image into Azure Container Registry (ACR), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Microsoft Foundry.

## Validate the deployed Agent
```python
# Before running the sample:
#    pip install --pre azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0b4

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
import json

foundry_account = "<Your Foundry Account Name>"
foundry_project = "<Your Foundry Project Name>"
agent_name = "<Your Deployed Agent Name>"

project_endpoint = f"https://{foundry_account}.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/{foundry_project}"

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)

# Get an existing agent
agent = project_client.agents.get(agent_name=agent_name)
print(f"Retrieved agent: {agent.name}")

openai_client = project_client.get_openai_client()
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()

response = openai_client.responses.create(
    input=[{"role": "user", "content": "Ask the user where they are, then look up the weather there."}],
    conversation=conversation.id,
    extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
)

call_id = ""
for item in response.output:
    if item.type == "function_call" and item.name == "__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__":
        print(f"Agent ask: {item.arguments}")
        call_id = item.call_id

if not call_id:
    print(f"No human input is required, output: {response.output_text}")
else:
    human_response = {"resume": "San Francisco"}
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        input=[
            {
                "type": "function_call_output",
                "call_id": call_id,
                "output": json.dumps(human_response)
            }],
        conversation=conversation.id,
        extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
    )
    print(f"Human response: {human_response['resume']}")
    print(f"Agent response: {response.output_text}")
```

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service**
   - Endpoint configured
   - Chat model deployed (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4`)
   - Note your endpoint URL and deployment name

2. **Azure CLI**
   - Installed and authenticated
   - Run `az login` and verify with `az account show`

3. **Python 3.10 or higher**
   - Verify your version: `python --version`
   - If you have Python 3.9 or older, install a newer version:
     - Windows: `winget install Python.Python.3.12`
     - macOS: `brew install python@3.12`
     - Linux: Use your package manager

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (required)

This sample loads environment variables from a local `.env` file if present.

```powershell
# Replace with your actual values
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"
$env:AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will start the hosted agent locally on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Interacting with the Agent locally

#### Initial Request (Triggering Human Input)

Send a request that will cause the agent to ask for human input:

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
$body = @{
    input = "Ask the user where they are, then look up the weather there."
    stream = $false
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8088/responses -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Bash/curl (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
   -d '{"input": "Ask the user where they are, then look up the weather there.", "stream": false}'
```

**Response Structure:**

The agent will respond with an interrupt request:

```json
{
  "conversation": {
    "id": "conv_abc123..."
  },
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "function_call",
      "name": "__hosted_agent_adapter_interrupt__",
      "call_id": "call_xyz789...",
      "arguments": "{\"question\": \"Where are you located?\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Providing Human Feedback

Resume the conversation by providing the human's response:

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
$body = @{
    input = @(
        @{
            type = "function_call_output"
            call_id = "call_xyz789..."
            output = '{"resume": "San Francisco"}'
        }
    )
    stream = $false
    conversation = @{
        id = "conv_abc123..."
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8088/responses -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Bash/curl (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
   -d '{
     "input": [
       {
         "type": "function_call_output",
         "call_id": "call_xyz789...",
         "output": "{\"resume\": \"San Francisco\"}"
       }
     ],
     "stream": false,
     "conversation": {
       "id": "conv_abc123..."
     }
   }'
```

**Final Response:**

The agent will continue execution and provide the final result:

```json
{
  "conversation": {
    "id": "conv_abc123..."
  },
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "message",
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I looked up the weather in San Francisco. Result: It's sunny in San Francisco."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Use this command to build the image locally:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
