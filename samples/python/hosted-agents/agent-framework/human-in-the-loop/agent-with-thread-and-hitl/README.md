# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to build a Microsoft Agent Framework chat agent with **human-in-the-loop** approval workflows, host it using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-agentframework/), and deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli#create-a-hosted-agent) extension.

This sample is adapted from the [agent-framework sample](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/samples/getting_started/tools/ai_function_with_approval_and_threads.py).

## How It Works

### Human-in-the-loop approval

In [main.py](main.py), the agent is created using `AzureOpenAIChatClient` and includes an `@ai_function` decorated with `approval_mode="always_require"`. This means any call to the function (e.g., `add_to_calendar`) will escalate to a human reviewer before execution.

When the agent determines it needs to call an approval-required function, the response includes a `function_call` with name `__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__`. The caller must then provide feedback (`approve`, `reject`, or additional guidance) to continue the workflow.

### Thread persistence

- The sample uses `JsonLocalFileAgentThreadRepository` for `AgentThread` persistence, creating a JSON file per conversation ID under `./thread_storage`. 

- An in-memory alternative, `InMemoryAgentThreadRepository`, lives in the `azure.ai.agentserver.agentframework.persistence` module.

- To store thread messages elsewhere, inherit from `SerializedAgentThreadRepository` and override the following methods:
```python
class SerializedAgentThreadRepository(AgentThreadRepository):
    async def read_from_storage(self, conversation_id: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        """Read the serialized thread from storage.

        :param conversation_id: The conversation ID.
        :type conversation_id: str

        :return: The serialized thread if available, None otherwise.
        :rtype: Optional[Any]
        """
        ...

    async def write_to_storage(self, conversation_id: str, serialized_thread: Any) -> None:
        """Write the serialized thread to storage.

        :param conversation_id: The conversation ID.
        :type conversation_id: str
        :param serialized_thread: The serialized thread to save.
        :type serialized_thread: Any
        :return: None
        :rtype: None
        """
        ...
```

These hooks let you plug in any backing store (blob storage, databases, etc.) without changing the rest of the sample.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agentserver-agentframework/), which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli#create-a-hosted-agent) extension. The extension builds a container image into Azure Container Registry (ACR), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Microsoft Foundry.

## Validate the deployed Agent
```python
# Before running the sample:
#    pip install --pre azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0b4

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
import json

foundry_account = "<Your Foundry Account Name>"
foundry_project = "<Your Foundry Project Name>"
agent_name = "<Your Deployed Agent Name>"

project_endpoint = f"https://{foundry_account}.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/{foundry_project}"

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)

# Get an existing agent
agent = project_client.agents.get(agent_name=agent_name)
print(f"Retrieved agent: {agent.name}")

openai_client = project_client.get_openai_client()
conversation = openai_client.conversations.create()

response = openai_client.responses.create(
    input="Add a dentist appointment on March 15th",
    conversation=conversation.id,
    extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
)

call_id = ""
for item in response.output:
    if item.type == "function_call" and item.name == "__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__":
        args = json.loads(item.arguments)
        print(f"Agent will add {args['event_name']} on {args['date']}")
        call_id = item.call_id

if not call_id:
    print(f"No human input is required, output: {response.output_text}")
else:
    human_response = "approve"
    response = openai_client.responses.create(
        input=[
            {
                "type": "function_call_output",
                "call_id": call_id,
                "output": human_response
            }],
        conversation=conversation.id,
        extra_body={"agent_reference": {"name": agent.name, "type": "agent_reference"}},
    )
    print(f"Human response: {human_response}")
    print(f"Agent response: {response.output_text}")
```

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service**
   - Endpoint configured
   - Chat model deployed (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4`)
   - Note your endpoint URL and deployment name

2. **Azure CLI**
   - Installed and authenticated
   - Run `az login` and verify with `az account show`

3. **Python 3.10 or higher**
   - Verify your version: `python --version`
   - If you have Python 3.9 or older, install a newer version:
     - Windows: `winget install Python.Python.3.12`
     - macOS: `brew install python@3.12`
     - Linux: Use your package manager

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (required)
- `OPENAI_API_VERSION` - The API version (e.g., `2025-03-01-preview`)

This sample loads environment variables from a local `.env` file if present. Copy `.envtemplate` to `.env` and fill in your Azure OpenAI details:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<endpoint-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment-name>
```

```powershell
# Replace with your actual values
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
$env:OPENAI_API_VERSION="2025-03-01-preview"
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will start the hosted agent locally on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Interacting with the Agent locally

**Step 1: Send a user request**

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
$body = @{
    agent = @{ name = "local_agent"; type = "agent_reference" }
    stream = $false
    input = "Add a dentist appointment on March 15th"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8088/responses -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Bash/curl (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
   -d '{"agent":{"name":"local_agent","type":"agent_reference"},"stream":false,"input":"Add a dentist appointment on March 15th"}'
```

A response that requires a human decision looks like this (formatted for clarity):

```json
{
  "conversation": {"id": "<conversation_id>"},
  "output": [
    {...},
    {
      "type": "function_call",
      "id": "func_xxx",
      "name": "__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__",
      "call_id": "<call_id>",
      "arguments": "{\"event_name\":\"Dentist Appointment\",\"date\":\"2024-03-15\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

Capture these values from the response; you will need them to provide feedback:

- `conversation.id`
- The `call_id` associated with `__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__`

**Step 2: Provide human feedback**

Send a `CreateResponse` request with a `function_call_output` message that contains your decision (`approve`, `reject`, or additional guidance). Replace the placeholders before running the command:

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
$body = @{
    agent = @{ name = "local_agent"; type = "agent_reference" }
    stream = $false
    conversation = @{ id = "<conversation_id>" }
    input = @(
        @{
            call_id = "<call_id>"
            output = "approve"
            type = "function_call_output"
        }
    )
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:8088/responses -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Bash/curl (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
curl -sS -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8088/responses \
   -d '{"agent":{"name":"local_agent","type":"agent_reference"},"stream":false,"conversation":{"id":"<conversation_id>"},"input":[{"call_id":"<call_id>","output":"approve","type":"function_call_output"}]}'
```

When the reviewer response is accepted, the agent executes the approved function and returns the final output.

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents?view=foundry&tabs=cli

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Use this command to build the image locally:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
