## Overview
This infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution deploys a network-secured Azure AI agent environment with private networking and role-based access control (RBAC).

Standard setup supports private network isolation through utilizing **Bring Your Own Virtual Network (BYO VNet)** approach, also known as **custom VNet support with subnet delegation.** 

This implementation gives you full control over the inbound and outbound communication paths for your agent. You can restrict access to only the resources explicitly required by your agent, such as storage accounts, databases, or APIs, while blocking all other traffic by default. This approach ensures that your agent operates within a tightly scoped network boundary, reducing the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access. By default, this setup simplifies security configuration while enforcing strong isolation guarantees, ensuring that each agent deployment remains secure, compliant, and aligned with enterprise networking policies. 

---

## Key Information

**Limited Region Support for Class A Subnet IPs**
- Class A is supported in a subset of regions supported by the Azure AI Foundry Agent service. 

**Region and Resource Placement Requirements**
- **All Foundry workspace resources should be in the same region as the VNet**, including CosmosDB, Storage Account, AI Search, Foundry Account, Project, Managed Identity. The only exception is within the Foundry Account, you may choose to deploy your model to a different region, and any cross-region communication will be handled securely within our network infrastructure.
  - **Note:** Your Virtual Network can be in a different resource group than your Foundry workspace resources

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Active Azure subscription with appropriate permissions**
   - **Azure AI Account Owner**: Needed to create a cognitive services account and project 
   - **Owner or Role Based Access Administrator**: Needed to assign RBAC to the required resources (Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Storage) 
   - **Azure AI User**: Needed to create and edit agents

1. **Register Resource Providers**

   Make sure you have an active Azure subscription that allows registering resource providers. For example, subnet delegation requires the Microsoft.App provider to be registered in your subscription. If it's not already registered, run the commands below:

   ```bash
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Search'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Network'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.App'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'
   ```

1. Network administrator permissions (if operating in a restricted or enterprise environment)

1. Sufficient quota for all resources in your target Azure region
    * If no parameters are passed in, this template creates an Azure AI Foundry resource, Foundry project, Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, Azure AI Search, and Azure Storage account
1. Azure CLI installed and configured on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server

---

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### Networking Requirements
1. Review network requirements and plan Virtual Network address space (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16 or an alternative non-overlapping address space)

2. Two subnets are needed as well:  
    - **Agent Subnet** (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client for Agent workloads, delegated to Microsoft.App/environments. The recommended size should be /24 for this delegated subnet. 
    - **Private endpoint Subnet** (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints 
    - Ensure that the address spaces for the used VNET does not overlap with any existing networks in your Azure environment or reserved IP ranges like the following: 169.254.0.0/16,172.30.0.0/16,172.31.0.0/16,192.0.2.0/24,0.0.0.0/8,127.0.0.0/8,100.100.0.0/17,100.100.192.0/19,100.100.224.0/19,10.0.0.0/8.
    This includes all address space(s) you have in your VNET if you have more than one, and peered VNETs.
  
  > **Notes:** 
  - If you do not provide an existing virtual network, the template will create a new virtual network with the default address spaces and subnets described above. If you use an existing virtual network, make sure it already contains two subnets (Agent and Private Endpoint) before deploying the template.
  - You must ensure the Foundry account was successfully created so that underlying caphost has also succeeded. Then proceed to deploying the project caphost bicep. 
  - You must ensure the subnet is not already in use by another account. It must be an exclusive subnet for the Foundry account.
  - You must ensure the subnet is exclusively delegated to __Microsoft.App/environments__ and cannot be used by any other Azure resources.
  

### Account Deletion Prerequisites and Cleanup Guidance

Before deleting an **Account** resource, it is essential to first delete the associated **Account Capability Host**.  
Failure to do so may result in residual dependencies—such as subnets and other provisioned resources (e.g., ACA applications)—remaining linked to the capability host.  
This can lead to errors such as **"Subnet already in use"** when attempting to reuse the same subnet in a different account deployment.

**Cleanup Options**

**1. Full Account Removal**: To completely remove an account, you must delete and purge the account. Simply deleting the account is not sufficient, you must purge so that deletion of the associated capability host is triggered. The service will automatically handle the removal of the capability host and any linked resources in the background. To purge the account, use the following [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource). Please allow approximately max of 20 minutes for all resources to be fully unlinked from the account.
 
**2. Retain Account, Remove Capability Host**: If you intend to retain the account but remove the capability host, execute the script `deleteCaphost.sh` located in this folder. After deletion, allow approximately max of 20 minutes for all resources to be fully unlinked from the account. To recreate the capability host for the account, use the script `createCaphost.sh` located in the same folder.

> **Important**: Before deleting the account capability host, ensure that the **project capability host** is deleted.
 


### Template Customization

Note: If not provided, the following resources will be created automatically for you:
- VNet and two subnets
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL  
- Azure AI Search
- Azure Storage

#### Parameters

1. **Use Existing Virtual Network and Subnets**

To use an existing VNet and subnets, set the existingVnetResourceId parameter to the full Azure Resource ID of the target VNet and its address range, and provide the names of the two required subnets.  If the existing VNet is associated with private DNS zones, set the existingDnsZones parameter to the resource group name in which the zones are located. For example:
- param existingVnetResourceId = "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet-name>"
- param agentSubnetName string = 'agent-subnet' //optional, default is 'agent-subnet'
- param agentSubnetPrefix string = '192.168.0.0/24' //optional, default is '192.168.0.0/24'
- param peSubnetName string = 'pe-subnet' //optional, default is 'pe-subnet'
- param peSubnetPrefix string = '192.168.1.0/24' //optional, default is '192.168.1.0/24'
- param existingDnsZones = {
       
         'privatelink.services.ai.azure.com': 'privzoneRG' //add resource group name where your private DNS zone is located
       
         'privatelink.openai.azure.com': '' //Leave empty to create new private dns zone... }

💡 If subnets information is provided then make sure it exist within the specified VNet to avoid deployment errors. If subnet information is not provided, the template will create subnets with the default address space.


2. **Use an existing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**

To use an existing Cosmos DB for NoSQL resource, set cosmosDBResourceId parameter to the full Azure Resource ID of the target Cosmos DB.
- param azureCosmosDBAccountResourceId string =  /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/{cosmosDbAccountName}


3. **Use an existing Azure AI Search resource**

To use an existing Azure AI Search resource, set aiSearchServiceResourceId parameter to the full Azure resource Id of the target Azure AI Search resource. 
 - param aiSearchResourceId string = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{searchServiceName}


4. **Use an existing Azure Storage account**

To use an existing Azure Storage account, set aiStorageAccountResourceId parameter to the full Azure resource Id of the target Azure Storage account resource. 
- param aiStorageAccountResourceId string = /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}

## Network Secured Agent Project Architecture Deep Dive

### Core Components

**Azure AI Foundry** resource
- Central orchestration point
- Manages service connections
- Set networking and policy configurations

**Foundry** project
- Defines the workspace configuration 
- Service integration 
- Agents are created within a specific project, and each project acts as an isolated workspace. This means:
  - All agents in the same project share access to the same file storage, thread storage (conversation history), and search indexes.
  - Data is isolated between projects. Agents in one project cannot access resources from another. Projects are currently the unit of  sharing and isolation in Foundry. See the what is AI foundry article for more information on Foundry projects. 

**Bring Your Own (BYO) Azure Resources**: ensures all sensitive data remains under customer control. All agents created using our service are stateful, meaning they retain information across interactions. With this setup, agent states are automatically stored in customer-managed, single-tenant resources. The required Bring Your Own Resources include: 
- BYO File Storage: All files uploaded by developers (during agent configuration) or end-users (during interactions) are stored directly in the customer’s Azure Storage account.
- BYO Search: All vector stores created by the agent leverage the customer’s Azure AI Search resource.
- BYO Thread Storage: All customer messages and conversation history will be stored in the customer’s own Azure Cosmos DB account.

By bundling these BYO features (file storage, search, and thread storage), the standard setup guarantees that your deployment is secure by default. All data processed by Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is automatically stored at rest in your own Azure resources, helping you meet internal policies, compliance requirements, and enterprise security standards.

### Network Security Design
This implementation utilizes a BYO VNet (Bring Your Own Virtual Network) approach, also known as custom VNet support with subnet delegation. Within your existing virtual network, one delegated subnet will be created.

Network Security
- Public network access disabled
- Private endpoints for all services
- Network ACLs with deny by default

**Network Infrastructure**
- A Virtual Network (192.168.0.0/16) is created (if existing isn't passed in)
- Agent Subnet (192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client
- Private endpoint Subnet (192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints

**Private Endpoints** 
Private endpoints ensure secure, internal-only connectivity. Private endpoints are created for the following:
- Azure AI Foundry
- Azure AI Search
- Azure Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB

**Private DNS Zones**
| Private Link Resource Type | Sub Resource | Private DNS Zone Name | Public DNS Zone Forwarders |
|----------------------------|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Azure AI Foundry**       | account      | `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com`<br>`privatelink.openai.azure.com`<br>`privatelink.services.ai.azure.com` | `cognitiveservices.azure.com`<br>`openai.azure.com`<br>`services.ai.azure.com` |
| **Azure AI Search**        | searchService| `privatelink.search.windows.net` | `search.windows.net` |
| **Azure Cosmos DB**        | Sql          | `privatelink.documents.azure.com` | `documents.azure.com` |
| **Azure Storage**          | blob         | `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` | `blob.core.windows.net` |

### Authentication & Authorization

# (Optional) Adding Multiple Projects to AI Foundry Deployment

This guide explains how to add additional projects to your existing AI Foundry deployment with network security and capability hosts.

## Overview

After deploying your initial AI Foundry setup using `main.bicep`, you can add additional projects using the modular approach provided in this repository. Each new project will:

- ✅ **Reuse existing shared infrastructure** (AI Services account, Storage, Cosmos DB, AI Search, VNet)
- ✅ **Create independent projects** with unique identities and connections
- ✅ **Set up proper role assignments** and capability hosts for each project
- ✅ **Maintain network security** configurations from your original deployment
- ✅ **Deploy independently** without affecting existing projects

## Files Added

### Core Deployment Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `add-project.bicep` | Main Bicep template for adding new projects |
| `add-project.bicepparam` | Parameters file template for new projects |
| `modules-network-secured/ai-project-identity-unique.bicep` | Modified project module with unique connection names |
| `modules-network-secured/blob-storage-container-role-assignments-unique.bicep` | Modified storage role assignment module |

### Helper Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get-existing-resources.ps1` | PowerShell script to discover existing resource names |

## Prerequisites

1. ✅ **Existing AI Foundry deployment** completed using `main.bicep`
2. ✅ **Azure CLI** installed and logged in
3. ✅ **Proper permissions** on the resource group and existing resources
4. ✅ **Resource names** from your existing deployment

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Discover Existing Resource Names

Run the PowerShell script to automatically discover your existing resource names:

```powershell
# Navigate to your repository folder
cd "path\to\your\AgentRepro\folder"

# Run the discovery script
.\get-existing-resources.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group-name"

# Optional: Include subscription ID if needed
.\get-existing-resources.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group-name" -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id"
```

**Example output:**
```
=== Summary for add-project.bicepparam ===
param existingAccountName = 'aiservicesytlz'
param existingAiSearchName = 'aiservicesytlzsearch'
param existingStorageName = 'aiservicesytlzstorage'
param existingCosmosDBName = 'aiservicesytlzcosmosdb'
param accountResourceGroupName = 'agenticvnet'
param aiSearchResourceGroupName = 'agenticvnet'
param storageResourceGroupName = 'agenticvnet'
param cosmosDBResourceGroupName = 'agenticvnet'
```

### Step 2: Configure Parameters File

Copy the output from Step 1 and update your `add-project.bicepparam` file:

### Step 3: Deploy the New Project

Deploy using Azure CLI:

```powershell
az deployment group create `
  --resource-group "your-resource-group" `
  --template-file "add-project.bicep" `
  --parameters "add-project.bicepparam"
```

## Adding Multiple Projects

To add additional projects, repeat the process with different parameter values:

### For a Third Project:

1. **Update project-specific parameters:**
   ```bicep
   param projectName = 'thirdproject'  // Must be unique
   param displayName = 'Third Project'
   param projectCapHost = 'caphostthird'  // Must be unique
   ```

3. **Deploy using the new parameters file:**
   ```powershell
   az deployment group create `
     --resource-group "your-resource-group" `
     --template-file "add-project.bicep" `
     --parameters "add-project.bicepparam"
   ```

## What Gets Created

Each new project deployment creates:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AI Foundry Project** | New project under your existing AI Services account |
| **Managed Identity** | Project-specific system-assigned identity |
| **Unique Connections** | Project-specific connections to shared resources |
| **Capability Host** | Configured for Agents with proper connections |
| **RBAC Assignments** | Proper permissions on shared resources |

### Role Assignments Created:

- ✅ **Storage Blob Data Contributor** on Storage Account
- ✅ **Storage Blob Data Owner** on project-specific containers
- ✅ **Cosmos DB Operator** on Cosmos DB Account
- ✅ **Cosmos Built-In Data Contributor** on project-specific containers
- ✅ **Search Index Data Contributor** on AI Search Service
- ✅ **Search Service Contributor** on AI Search Service

## Configuration Reference

### Required Parameters (Must Customize for Each Project)

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `projectName` | Unique name for the project | `'secondproject'` |
| `displayName` | Display name in Azure portal | `'Second Project'` |
| `projectCapHost` | Unique capability host name | `'caphostsecond'` |
| `projectDescription` | Description of the project | `'My second AI project'` |

### Existing Resource Parameters (From Script)

| Parameter | Description | Source |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `existingAccountName` | AI Services account name | Output from `get-existing-resources.ps1` |
| `existingAiSearchName` | AI Search service name | Output from `get-existing-resources.ps1` |
| `existingStorageName` | Storage account name | Output from `get-existing-resources.ps1` |
| `existingCosmosDBName` | Cosmos DB account name | Output from `get-existing-resources.ps1` |
| `*ResourceGroupName` | Resource group names | Usually same as deployment RG |
| `*SubscriptionId` | Subscription IDs | Usually same subscription |


## Security Considerations

- ✅ **Least Privilege**: Each project gets only the permissions it needs
- ✅ **Isolated Containers**: Projects get separate storage containers
- ✅ **Network Security**: Inherits network security from original deployment
- ✅ **Unique Identities**: Each project has its own managed identity

## Limitations

- 📝 All projects share the same model deployments
- 📝 Projects must be in the same region as the original deployment
- 📝 Network configuration is inherited from original deployment
